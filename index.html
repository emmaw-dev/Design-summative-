    <h1>Dogs sences </h1>
    <p id="fact">Dogs have five main senses—smell, hearing, sight, touch, and taste—with smell 
      and hearing being particularly acute compared to humans. Their highly developed sense of smell 
      allows them to detect emotions, diseases, and a vast range of odors, while their superior 
      hearing enables them to perceive sounds beyond the human range. While their vision is not as 
      sharp as a human's in some aspects, they have a wider field of vision.
